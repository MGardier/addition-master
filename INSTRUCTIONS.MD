## ðŸŽ® Operation Master

Welcome, Agent, to **Operation Master**. This project challenges you to build a command-line calculator that handles basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to construct a JavaScript script that executes these tasks with maximum efficiency and clarity. The clock is tickingâ€”you have 15 minutes before this project self-destructs.

## ðŸš€ RÃ¨gles du jeu

1. **Display available operations:**  
   The program must first display the different arithmetic operations available and prompt the user to select one.

2. **Validate the operator:**  
   Ensure the user's input is a valid operator. If not, display an error message and prompt them again until a correct operation is chosen.

3. **Input validation for numbers:**  
   Ask the user to input two numbers. Ensure that both numbers:

   - Are valid numerical inputs.
   - Are greater than -100 trillion and less than 100 trillion.
   - For division, the second number cannot be zero. If any of these conditions are violated, display an error message and prompt the user to input valid numbers again.

4. **Display calculation and result:**  
   Perform the chosen arithmetic operation and display the result to the user.

5. **Replay or exit:**  
   Ask the user if they want to perform another calculation. If yes, restart the process from step 1. If not, end the program.

## ðŸ›  Final Mission

Your final task, Agent, is to optimize the solution for both **readability** and **performance**. Code must be clean, concise, and efficient to ensure the operation's success.

This message will self-destruct in 10 minutes. Good luck, Agent.
